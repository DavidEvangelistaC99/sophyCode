## PPI and Signal Processing Results

This folder contains the main outputs obtained from the signal processing
pipeline of the SOPHy radar experiments.  
All results were generated using the **Signal Chain library** from the ROJ repository.  

It includes:

- `ppi/`: Plan Position Indicator (PPI) plots
- `doppler_spectrum/`: Doppler spectrum plots
- `gifs/`: Animated visualizations (GIFs) of radar reflectivity and radial velocity PPI
